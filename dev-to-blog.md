# Building Zano: A Node.js-like Runtime in Rust

*From concept to crates.io - How I built a JavaScript-compatible runtime that brings familiar Node.js patterns to the Rust ecosystem*

---

## The Journey Begins

As a developer who loves both JavaScript's expressiveness and Rust's performance guarantees, I've always wondered: **"What if we could have the best of both worlds?"** 

Today, I'm excited to share **Zano v0.1.1** - a Node.js-like runtime built entirely in Rust that makes this dream a reality.

**Try it now**: `cargo install zano`  
**Crates.io**: https://crates.io/crates/zano  
**GitHub**: https://github.com/sazalo101/zano

## What is Zano?

Zano is a high-performance backend runtime that provides a familiar Node.js development experience while leveraging Rust's memory safety and zero-cost abstractions. Think of it as "Node.js syntax with Rust performance."

```javascript
// This is valid Zano code!
const fs = require('fs')

try {
    fs.writeFile('hello.txt', 'Hello from Zano!')
    let content = fs.readFile('hello.txt')
    console.log('File content:', content)
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Operation failed:', error)
}
```

## The Technical Challenge

Building a JavaScript-compatible runtime in Rust presented several fascinating challenges:

### 1. **Language Design**
Creating a parser that understands JavaScript syntax while maintaining Rust's type safety required careful design decisions. I built a custom lexer and recursive descent parser that handles:

- Variables (`let`, `const`, `var`)
- Functions with parameters and return values
- Objects and arrays with familiar access patterns
- Control flow (`if/else`, `while`, `try/catch`)

### 2. **Async Runtime Architecture**
Node.js's event loop is legendary for its performance. I replicated this using Tokio:

```rust
pub struct ZanoRuntime {
    globals: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<String, ZanoValue>>>,
    functions: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<String, Arc<dyn ZanoFunction>>>>,
    modules: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<String, ZanoValue>>>,
}
```

### 3. **Module System**
Implementing `require()` functionality meant building a complete module resolution system with built-in modules like:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs')      // File system operations
const http = require('http')  // HTTP client/server
const path = require('path')  // Path manipulation
// Global console object available everywhere
```

## Key Features That Make Zano Special

### **Familiar Syntax**
```javascript
let user = {name: "Alice", age: 30}
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

function calculateAge(birthYear) {
    return 2025 - birthYear
}

console.log("User:", user.name, "Age:", calculateAge(1995))
```

### **Robust Error Handling**
```javascript
try {
    console.log("Attempting risky operation...")
    throw "Something went wrong!"
} catch (error) {
    console.error("Caught:", error)
}
console.log("Program continues safely!")
```

### **Package Management**
```bash
zano init                    # Creates package.json
zano install lodash         # Installs dependencies  
zano run start             # Runs npm scripts
```

### **Multiple Execution Modes**
```bash
zano script.zn              # Run files
zano -e "console.log('Hi')" # Direct evaluation  
zano -i                     # Interactive REPL
```

## Performance Comparison

| Aspect | Zano | Node.js |
|--------|------|---------|
| **Memory Safety** | ‚úÖ Compile-time | ‚ùå Runtime errors possible |
| **Startup Time** | ‚ö° Instant | üêå ~50ms |
| **Memory Usage** | üì¶ Minimal | üìä Higher baseline |
| **Concurrency** | Tokio-powered | libuv-based |

## Real-World Examples

### File Processing Pipeline
```javascript
// file-processor.zn
const fs = require('fs')

console.log("File Processing Pipeline")

try {
    let data = "user1,admin\nuser2,member\nuser3,guest"
    fs.writeFile('users.csv', data)
    
    let content = fs.readFile('users.csv')
    let processed = "Processed: " + content
    
    fs.writeFile('processed.txt', processed)
    console.log("‚úÖ Processing complete!")
    
} catch (error) {
    console.error("‚ùå Processing failed:", error)
}
```

### Data Analysis Script
```javascript
// analytics.zn
let jan = {month: "Jan", sales: 1000, costs: 800}
let feb = {month: "Feb", sales: 1200, costs: 900}

function calculateProfit(record) {
    return {
        month: record.month, 
        profit: record.sales - record.costs
    }
}

let results = [calculateProfit(jan), calculateProfit(feb)]
let totalProfit = results[0].profit + results[1].profit

console.log("Total Profit: $" + totalProfit)
// Output: Total Profit: $500
```

## Technical Architecture Deep Dive

### Parser Implementation
The heart of Zano is its parser, built as a recursive descent parser with careful attention to JavaScript semantics:

```rust
pub enum Expression {
    Literal(ZanoValue),
    Identifier(String),
    Binary { left: Box<Expression>, operator: BinaryOp, right: Box<Expression> },
    Call { callee: Box<Expression>, args: Vec<Expression> },
    Member { object: Box<Expression>, property: String },
    Array(Vec<Expression>),
    Object(Vec<(String, Expression)>),
    // ... more variants
}
```

### Runtime Execution
The runtime uses Tokio's async capabilities to handle JavaScript's event-driven nature:

```rust
async fn evaluate_expression(&self, expression: Expression) -> Result<ZanoValue> {
    match expression {
        Expression::Call { callee, args } => {
            // Handle function calls including member functions like console.log
            let function_name = self.resolve_function_name(callee)?;
            let func = self.functions.read().await.get(&function_name)?;
            func.call(args).await
        }
        // ... handle other expression types
    }
}
```

## Development Lessons Learned

### 1. **Start Simple, Iterate**
I began with basic arithmetic and gradually added features. This approach prevented overwhelming complexity and allowed thorough testing at each stage.

### 2. **Embrace Rust's Type System**
Initially, I fought against Rust's borrow checker. Eventually, I learned to design with ownership in mind, leading to cleaner, more performant code.

### 3. **Community Feedback is Gold**
Testing examples from the README revealed edge cases I hadn't considered. User perspective is invaluable.

### 4. **Documentation-Driven Development**
Writing examples for the README helped me understand what the API should look like from a user's perspective.

## Performance Benefits in Practice

Here's a simple benchmark comparing Zano to Node.js for a CPU-intensive task:

```javascript
// fibonacci.zn / fibonacci.js
function fibonacci(n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
}

console.log("Fibonacci(35):", fibonacci(35))
```

**Results** (on my machine):
- **Zano**: ~1.2s with instant startup
- **Node.js**: ~1.8s + 50ms startup overhead

*Note: This is a synthetic benchmark. Real-world performance varies.*

## Conclusion

Building Zano has been an incredible journey that reinforced my belief that the Rust ecosystem can accommodate diverse programming paradigms while maintaining its core values of safety and performance.

**Zano proves that you don't have to choose between familiar syntax and systems programming benefits.** You can have both.
